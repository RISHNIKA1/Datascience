    Types :
        a. if statement  b. if...else statement  c. if..elif..else statement

    a. if statement :
        if means if a condition is True , Then execute that block.

    b. if else statement :
        * When condition is True , do one thing.
        * when condition is False , do something else.

    c. if elif else statement:
        when you want to check multiple condition use elif.

10. What is Indentation in Python?
        * Indentation is spaces at the  begining of the code line.
        * In python Indentation indicate a block of code.
        * other programming languaages Indentation is readability purpose only but python Indentation is very important.

# Summary 

    if       --> Check first condition.
    elif     --> Check 2nd condition when 1st one is fails.
    else     --> Runs when no condition is True.
    :        --> used at the end of the code line.
    Indent   --> Required for code block.

        b. while loop   - when you repeat based on a condition.

2. What is for loop?
        * A for loop in python is used to iterate over a sequence and repeat a block of code fixed number of times.
        * Syntax : for i in range(start , end, step):
        * usage  : List, Strings, Range

3. what is while loop?
        * A While loop in python is used to execute a block of code as long as the condition is True.
        * Syntax : while condion :
        * Usage : repeat until something changes

4. python keywords (break, continue, pass)?
        * break    - break statement used to stop the loop even if while condion is True. (stop the loop)
        * continue - continue statements are used to skip the current iteration and continue to the next.(skip the step)
        * pass     - pass statements are placeholder used to avoid getting an error.

# ERRORS HANDLING

1. what is error?
        Error is an problem in that program that causes it to stop or behave unexpectedly.

2. Two types of error?
        * Mistake in writting code  - if x==5 print("hi")
        * Happens during program execution - 10/0 (divison by zero)

3. Exception Handling?
        Instead of stopping the program when an error occurs, python lets you handled it using try,except etc..

4. Common keywoords in exception handling?
        * try - used to write a risky code (which cause error)
        * except - caches the errors and handles it
        * else - Runs only if no error occur in try block
        * finally - always runs (even if errors occur)
        * raise - manually trigger an exception

5. Common Excepton?

2. Basic syntax to open file ?
        file = open("name.txt","mode")

3. Common Modes?
        'r' = read
        'w' = write
        'a' = append
        'x' = create

        readlines()
        write()
        writelines()
        "a" mode
        with open(...) - use safe open
        os.path.exists(), os.path.isfile(), os.path.isdir() - check file
        os.remove() - delete file

# MODULES AND PACKAGES

1. what is modules?
        * Module is an simple python file (.py file).
        * That contains python code like ( functions, variabels, classes, logic)
        * which can imported and reused the other programs called modules.
        * Built-in Modules - random, math, os, datetime, sys 
        * user defines modules - you own .py files like (app.py)

2. Why use modules?
        * organized code better.
        * avoid rewritting the same code.
        * make your programs more readable and reusable.

3. What is Packages?
        * Packages is a folder.
        * That contains multiple modules and optional __init__.py file.

        * Index starts from 0.

2. String concept :
        string creation - name = "ARM", character = 'c'
        Accessed string - print(name[1]) o/p - R 
        string slicing  - name[:2]
        Concatination   - print(fname+ " " +lname)
        Formatting      - f-string (print(f'Name :{name}'))
