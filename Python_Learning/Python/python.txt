    a. if statement :
        if means if a condition is True , Then execute that block.

    b. if else statement :
        * When condition is True , do one thing.
        * when condition is False , do something else.

    c. if elif else statement:
        when you want to check multiple condition use elif.

10. What is Indentation in Python?
        * Indentation is spaces at the  begining of the code line.
        * In python Indentation indicate a block of code.
        * other programming languaages Indentation is readability purpose only but python Indentation is very important.

# Summary 

    if       --> Check first condition.
    elif     --> Check 2nd condition when 1st one is fails.
    else     --> Runs when no condition is True.
    :        --> used at the end of the code line.
    Indent   --> Required for code block.

        * usage  : List, Strings, Range

3. what is while loop?
        * A While loop in python is used to execute a block of code as long as the condition is True.
        * Syntax : while condion :
        * Usage : repeat until something changes

4. python keywords (break, continue, pass)?
        * break    - break statement used to stop the loop even if while condion is True. (stop the loop)
        * continue - continue statements are used to skip the current iteration and continue to the next.(skip the step)
        * pass     - pass statements are placeholder used to avoid getting an error.

        * Function is a block of code that runs only when it is called.
        * you can pass data and parameters it returns the output.
        * Its used to reuse code, avoid repetation, makes programs neat.

2. Types of Functions?
        * Built-in functions - len(), print(), type()
        * user defined functions - create a function using def keyword.

# COMMANDS

# ERRORS HANDLING

1. what is error?
        Error is an problem in that program that causes it to stop or behave unexpectedly.

2. Two types of error?
        * Mistake in writting code  - if x==5 print("hi")
        * Happens during program execution - 10/0 (divison by zero)

3. Exception Handling?
        Instead of stopping the program when an error occurs, python lets you handled it using try,except etc..

4. Common keywoords in exception handling?
        * try - used to write a risky code (which cause error)
        * except - caches the errors and handles it
        * else - Runs only if no error occur in try block
        * finally - always runs (even if errors occur)
        * raise - manually trigger an exception

5. Common Excepton?
        * ZeroDevisionError 
        * TypeError
        * ValueError
        * FileNotFoundError
        * IndexError
        * KeyError

# FILE HANDLING

1. What is file handling?
        * File handling allows you to create , read, write, delete files using python.
        * It is used to stored data permenently.

2. Basic syntax to open file ?
        file = open("name.txt","mode")

3. Common Modes?
        'r' = read
        'w' = write
        'a' = append
        'x' = create
        'b' = binary mode

        writelines()
        "a" mode
        with open(...) - use safe open
        os.path.exists(), os.path.isfile(), os.path.isdir() - check file
        os.remove() - delete file

# MODULES AND PACKAGES

1. what is modules?
        * Module is an simple python file (.py file).
        * That contains python code like ( functions, variabels, classes, logic)
        * which can imported and reused the other programs called modules.
        * Built-in Modules - random, math, os, datetime, sys 
        * user defines modules - you own .py files like (app.py)

2. Why use modules?
        * organized code better.
        * avoid rewritting the same code.
        * make your programs more readable and reusable.

3. What is Packages?
        * Packages is a folder.
        * That contains multiple modules and optional __init__.py file.
        * It allows you to organized reuabale model together.
        * NumPy, Pandas,My_package.py


# STRINGS

1. What is string?
        * striing is a sequence of character enclosed with single quoted '' or " " or """ """
        * strings cant changed after creation.
        * Index starts from 0.

2. String concept :
        string creation - name = "ARM", character = 'c'
        Accessed string - print(name[1]) o/p - R 
        string slicing  - name[:2]
        Concatination   - print(fname+ " " +lname)
        Formatting      - f-string (print(f'Name :{name}'))
                          .format  (print("Name :{}".format(name)))

        .split()  - "a,b,c".split(",") => ["a","b","c"]
        .join()   - " ".join(["hi","there"]) ==> hi there
        .find().  - "hello".find("e") => 1
        .count(sub) - "banana".count("a") =>3

## OOPS

1. What is oops?
        * OOPS is an Object Oriented Programming System.
        * Which can contain data and code. (data is the form of attributes and variables) and (code is the form of functions and methods.)
        * It helps in organizing code ,reuability and scalabilty.
        * python is a object-oriented programming languaage everything python is an object including classes, functions, and even basic data types.

2. Main pillers of OOPs?
        * Enacapsulation * Abstraction * Inheritance * Polymorphism

3. Main concept of OOPs?
        Class         - A Blueprint/Template for creating objects
        Object        - Instances of a class
        Constructor   - It is special method to Initialize a object (__init__():)
        Inheritance   - One class inherits from another class
        Encapsulation - Hiding internal details of an object
        Polymorphism  - Many forms - same function name , different behaviour
        self          - Refers the current instances of the class

4. Encapsulation?
        * Encapsulation is an object oriented Programming concept.
        * Used to Hiding intenal details of an objects and exposes only what is neccesary.
        * Using Public, Private and Protected access.

   Benefits:
        * Data hiding * control data * Flexible * cleaner code
   
   Implements:
        * public members (var) => accessible from anywhere
        * private members (__var) => not accessible directly from outside the class
        * Protected members (_var) => should not be accessible directly from outside the class

   # Example of encapsulation

        class BankAccount :
        def __init__(self,name,balance):
                self.name = name                # public attribute
                self.__balance = balance        # private attribute
                
        def deposit(self,amount):
                if amount >0:
                self.__balance += amount
        
        def get_balance(self):
                return self.__balance
        

        account = BankAccount("Rishi",25000)
        account.deposit(5000)

        print(account.name)                # Allowed
        print(account.get_balance())       # Allow this method
        #print(account.__balance)           # Error cant access private variable directly


5. Abstraction?
        * Abstraction hides complex implementation details and shows only the essential feature to the user.
        * Acieved using abstract class or abstract method.
        * Python provides ABC module to create abstract classes.

   Key points :
        Abstract Class :
                A class can't be initiated directly.
        Abstract Method :
                A method that has no body in the abstract class.
        Child Class :
                Implement the all abstract methods of the abstract class.

  # Example of Abstract classes

        from abc import ABC,abstractmethod

        # Abstract Class
        class Vehicle(ABC):
        
        @abstractmethod
        def start_engine(self):
                pass
        
        @abstractmethod
        def stop_engine(self):
                pass
        
        # child class
        class car(Vehicle):
        def start_engine(self):
                print("car engine started")
        
        def stop_engine(self):
                print("car engine stopped")
                

        # creating object of abstract class will raise error
        # V= Vehicle() # wrong

        # but we can use child class

        c=car()
        c.start_engine()
        c.stop_engine()
    
    
6. Inheritance?
        * Inheritance is an object-oriented programming concept.
        * where one class inherits from properties and behaviour from another class.
        * This allows code reusabilty and helps in building relationship between classes.
   
   Why use Inheritance?
        * Reuse code from existing classes.
        * organize code better
        * extenting or modifying functionality without changing the orginal code.

   # Example Inheriatnce 

        class Parent:
        def display(self):
                print("hi")
        
        class child(Parent):
        pass

        c = child()
        c.display() #inherit method

7. Types of Inheritance?
        * Single Inheriatnce
        * Multiple Inheritance
        * Multilvel Inheriatnce
        * Hiearachical Inheriatnce
        * Hyprid Inheriatnce

8. Single Inheriatnce?
        * A chile class inherits from one parent class. 
        * Ex : A --> B
   # Example of Single Inheritace

        class Animal:
        def sound(self):
                print("Animal sound")
        
        class dog(Animal):
        pass

        d= dog()
        d.sound()

9. Multiple Inheriatnce?
        * A child class inherits from more than one parent class.
        * Ex : A+B --> C
   # Example of Multiple Inheritance

        class Father():
        def Money(self):
                print("dads money")
        class Mother():
        def Phone(self):
                print("Moms Phone")
        class Child(Father,Mother):
        pass

        son = Child()
        son.Money()
        son.Phone()


10. Multilvel Inheriatnce?
        * A class inherits from a class which itself inherits from another class.
        * Ex : A-->B-->C
    # Examole of Multilevel Inheritance

        class Grandparent:
        def family(self):
                print("Grandparent family")

        class Father(Grandparent):
        pass

        class son(Father):
        pass

        child = son()
        child.family()

11. Hiearachical Inheritance?
        * Multiple Chils classes Inheriatnce single parent class.
        * Ex : A-->B,C,d

    # Example of Hireachical inheritance

        class vehicle:
        def fuel(self):
                print("Petrol or Diesel")
        
        class car(vehicle):
        pass

        class Bike(vehicle):
        pass

        c=car()
        b= Bike()
        c.fuel()
        b.fuel()

12. Hybrid Inheriatnce?
        * A combination of two or more types of inheritance
        * Ex : Mixed
    # Example of Hybrid Inheritance

        class A:
        def a(self):
                print("A")
        class B(A):
        def b(self):
                print("B")
        class C:
        def c(self):
                print("C")
        class D(B,C):
        def d(self):
                print("D")

        obj=D()
        obj.a()
        obj.b()
        obj.c()
        obj.d()

# Polymorphism 
        * Polymorphism is an OOPs concept.
        * Where same function or methods name behaves differently debends on object or data type it is working.
        * poly - Many , morphism - forms
        * Its allows writting flexible and reuabale code.

1. Types of Polymorphism ?
        * Method overloading
        * Method Overriding
   
   Method overriding:
        * A child class can override a method from the  parent class called method overriding.

   Mehod Overloading:
        * Having multiple method with the same name but different parameter signature.
        * It not suitbale for python. you can use some key points.

  # Example Method Overridng

        class Father:
        def house(self):
                print("White house")

        class Son(Father):
        def phone(self):
                print("sons phone")
                
        def house(self):
                print("yellow house")
                
        s=Son()
        s.house()
